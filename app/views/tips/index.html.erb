    Consensus Decision-making
  </h4>

    <p>
      Anrcho is a desicion making platform that ensures all desicions, goals, and aims are worked out through an open model of consensus where all parties involved must agree to support the proposal before it can be officially ratified.

      'Consensus may be defined professionally as an acceptable resolution, one that can be supported, even if not the "favourite" of each individual.' - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making">Wiki</a>

    <p>
      This careful process of discussion and deliberation is a necessity if we are to account for all those involved in the decisions that we make and ultimately how we organize.

    Proposals and Voting
  </h4>
    
  <div class="tip_card_body_text">
    <p>
      All posts are proposals, each one can be voted for, showing your agreement or your support, or voted against, effectively blocking the proposal and moving it to a section for review and revision.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      However, for any vote to count, it must first be verified by a peer who has already been verified using the captcha, so as to minimize abuse by 'trolls' or bots.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A feature will be available soon to reverse the blocking of proposals via majority vote so that anyone person can still block a proposal with a peer but have it reversed, keeping a check and balance between minority and majority.
